# Array Functions

There are a few fundamental differences when working with arrays in PHP and
Ruby. PHP uses the versatile `array` data type to handle both numerically
ordered collections and associative key/value pair collections. Ruby uses two
different objects -- `Array` for ordered collections, and `Hash` for
associative style collections.

In many of the array function examples we interchangeably use both Ruby arrays
and hashes to display the closest Ruby equivalent.

It is important to note that hashes in Ruby are unordered collections. If the
order of elements is important to the operation, you will need to use Ruby
arrays.
